def calculatePerimeter(grid, point):
   """
   Given an MxN grid of integers and a point in the 0-based grid,
   calculate the perimeter of the largest island to which that point belongs.
   An island is a group of horizontally and vertically contiguous cells with the same value.
   Example:
   Grid:
   ---�*****���-----
   | 0 * 1 * 0 | 0 |
   �---*�--*���-----
   | 2 * 1 * 0 | 1 |
   �---*--�*****�---
   | 0 * 1 | 1 * 0 |
   �---*********�---
   | 1 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
   ������-----------
   Given point: (1, 1)
   The perimeter here is denoted in *'s, and would be 10.
   @param grid: an MxN array of integers
   @param point: (x,y) tuple where x is the coordinate which corresponds to the row and y corresponds to the column
   @return: perimeter
